# Gender-Determination-by-Morphometry-of-Eyes
DATASET:
The dataset contains eye pictures of males and females. The dataset can be downloaded from the below link.

From the above link, you will be able to download a zip file named ‘eye_gender_data.zip’. After you extract this zip file, you will get four files:
train - contains all the images that are to be used for training your model.
Training_set.csv - this csv file has contains the labels for the training images
test - contains 9000+ images. For these images you are required to make predictions
Testing_set.csv - this is the order of the predictions for each image that is to be submitted on the platform. Make sure the predictions you submit are with their image’s filename in the same order as given in this file.
sample_submission.csv- this is the sample submission file for the data sprint

I have built a deep learning model that would determines gender by Morphometry of eyes. This is datathon challenge organised by DPhi where we have to predict the gender of a person from just the image of his eye (morphometry of eyes). I have built a convolutional neural network to predict the gender and achieved an accuracy of 89.33% on the test dataset.
All suggestions to improve the accuracy of the model is most welcome :)
